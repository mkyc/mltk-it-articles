# Hello world #

For last couple days, I was wondering how to create this blog with no backup services and other heavy stuff. This blogging platform is planned to be extremely easy, so less is more :) And I got it ... blog is blog. It gets published and can be published with sources! 

So here goes first post, even if blog application is still unfinished :) I need some testing data, so here we are go. 

GitHub has nice API. I will store articles in defined structure (/articles/[year]/[month]/[day]/[number].[extension]) and application will just have one scheduler to check if there was any new commit to master branch. Thanks to this if I will want to work for some time on some article I will just create branch for this article! Nice :) Application will need to have some small datasource for metadata (last commit, articles) but no extensive structure. I think of elsticSearch eventually but for now MongoDB is ok. 

Here goes first commit :)
