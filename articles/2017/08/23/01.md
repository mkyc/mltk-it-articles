# Docker timezone # 

Tags: docker, timezone, java

I'm still reading and planing infrastructure on described in previous post budget machines swarm cluster. StrongSwan looks like choice but I'm still in Ansible concepts. Anyway, I'm doing other things same time and I wanted to share simple pattern to fix timezone related issues in Docker containers running Java. 

In most systems you need correct time and timezone for many reasons. I had this issue couple days ago when remote SOAP interface required calculation of security hash'es in with usage of time. I didn't notice earlier that time related parameters were not set in containers. Here goes base template of fixed Dockerfile. 

```dockerfile
FROM anapsix/alpine-java:8_jdk_unlimited

RUN apk add tzdata && \
  cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Warsaw /etc/localtime && \
  echo "Europe/Warsaw" >  /etc/timezone && \
  apk del tzdata

VOLUME /tmp

ADD ./config/wait-for-it.sh /wait-for-it.sh
RUN chmod +x /wait-for-it.sh

ENV JAVA_OPTS "-Xms128m -Xmx256m -XX:+UseG1GC -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Duser.timezone=Europe/Warsaw"
```

That is most basic Java oriented Dockerfile I use in my environments. Notice `tzdata` part and `-Duser.timezone` parameter. I didn't have time to investigate why I have to add `-D` parameter but it does a trick. As far as I remember linux timezone has to be set before Java installation or later it can be fixed somewhere in `java/jre/lib` or somewhere there, but that is also a way to fix it.
