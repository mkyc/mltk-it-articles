# GitHub + Travis CI + Docker Cloud #

Tags: java, CI, docker

I managed to create first version of this blog and wanted to deploy it somewhere. Also as I always worked on DevOps things and I like to have everything automated I decided to use some publicly available solutions to make it happen. 

First things first. You have to have some build pipeline. I was using BitBucket private repositories for years and after building pipelines were introduced, building of my code was very easy. None of my work is secret so I decided to move to GitHub some time ago. Maybe someone from community will find my notes interesting. 

Building code from public GitHub repositories is easy with TravisCI. Code of this blog is located in [here](https://github.com/mkyc/eebp). To build it I just registered in TravisCI with my GitHub accout and allowed TravisCI to access my public repos. Travis build is defined [here](https://travis-ci.org/mkyc/eebp). BTW I noticed there is nice paid service TravisCI Pro for private GitHub repositories. After I allowed TravisCI to access my repos I had to add `.travis.yml` file to root of project to instruct building mechanism how to build the project. 

```yaml
language: java
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8
services:
  - mongodb
  - docker
after_success:
  - if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" == "master" ]; then
    docker login -u="$DOCKER_USERNAME" -p="$DOCKER_PASSWORD";
    docker push mnemos/eebp;
    fi
``` 

I think `services: - docker` is not important but didn't have time to investigate it more. What is worth pointing here is nice section `after_success`. As you can see I have there  `if` defined checking if Travis is building from `master` branch, and if yes then pipeline ends with `docker push` command. Thanks to this if I work on some feature I don't want get published (messy code) I use gitflow and it's enough. Finished features goes to master and gets published to docker registry. Notice `-u="$DOCKER_USERNAME" -p="$DOCKER_PASSWORD"` part of login operation. Variables are defined in settings panel.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) is part of [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) service. I created account in Docker Cloud some time ago for testing purposes. So now after Travis pushed image, it is available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mnemos/eebp/). Ahhhh â€¦ one more thing about building. I had some problem with instructing Travis to start `mvn package` instead of `mvn install` (had to pack for short vacation so no time for documentation digging) so I just changed `docker:build` phase of execution to `install`. You can see it in [this commit](https://github.com/mkyc/eebp/commit/21dcb9c4e5d8c02ef77b8d314a282b4df52caf82). 

From Docker Cloud view I can see my repos visible in Repositories tab.

From repo I was able to click `Lunch service` button and after giving parameters start application on node I created earlier. I was also able to put environment variables here (client_secret and client_id for GitHub authentication)

After that application got deployed on node and you can read this blog :)
